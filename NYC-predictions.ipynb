    "\n",
    "... after varying inputs like the fit range, data uncertainties and priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Qualitatively, both models agree for shared fitted parameters within 1-2 standard deviations\n",
    "* Both models roughly agree on the time where implemented social distancing measures started and how much contact was reduced ($\\sim 90$% within a month). \n",
    "* The initial doubling times seems surprisingly small at roughly half a day. \n",
    "* Both models do fail to fit the recovery time (which is not surprising because the number of recovered persons is not included in the analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "* SIHR predicts significantly fewer infections than SIR at later times while maintaining a higher contact rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both models seem to describe the data and allow predictions within a 1-2 week range.\n",
    "* Long time predictions are consistent when changing the fit window but are limited by the uncertainty of data.\n",
    "* SIHR is on the lower end of known infections--which seems unlikely as I would expect the number of infections to be underestimated. This observation may be explained by the fact that SIHR assumes hospitalized persons do not infect others. Combining this observation with the better fit statistics (e.g., logGBF), I would believe that the SIR model is superior in capturing the current NYC data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The April, 9th data point for hospitalizations lays significantly outside the predicted range when fitting all the data until this point.\n",
    "This could potentially be caused by\n",
    "\n",
    "* the reported numbers are not yet up to date\n",
    "* the hospital bed capacity has been reached and is below the reported 23k (setting SIHR to 17k fits this point).\n",
